# kr-vm-visualizer
Javascript audio visualizer in the style of the voice modulators from Knight Rider

I've been tinkering with the Web Audio APIs and thought it would be less boring if there was a visual component I could include on my test pages. Once I got that far the exact form it should take was obvious.

Usage: 

var vis = new Hartman.KRVMVisualizer(canvasElement, analyserNode, { options });
